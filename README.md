## OverView

In this project, we will apply the skills we have acquired in this cloud engineering course to design, deploy and operate a AWS Todo application. The App consist of two parts, a backend which is written in Nodejs and enitirely a micro-services architecture. And the other part is the front-end which is written in React TypeScript. The main use of this App is to allow users to login to the system and add a list of Todos Items. User requires to add a description for the Item and also allows users to upload an image base on the created Item. Users can also delete the Item and also marked the item as "DONE" on the checkbox to remind users the Item is completed.

This project reuse our existing "SERVERLESS" application and convert and extend into a microservice architecture. The microservice architecture makes it more easier to scale it to large systems. They are great enablers for continuous integration and delivery too. This includes independent scaling, independent releases and deployments  and independent development so that ACH service has its own codebase. After the application is divided into smaller services, we will containerize it and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes deployment pipeline, scalability, observability, Services, Networking and deployment strategies to service the system. 

For this project we will have 2 types of environments. One is windows 10 professional which is used to containerized our Todo App into micro-services architecture. The second is the Linux Environment which is used to create the AWS infrasturture and deploy it to the Cloud. 

For this project we will uses Oracle Vitualbox Virtual Machine for simulating the Linux Environment. If you personally has a Linux Environment you can skip to part. For windows 10 Professional installation, we will not cover here.

## Installation-Todo-Docker

* The only options to install Todo App is by cloning from the git hub please follow the instructions below .

    1. From the PowerShell Terminal, type in the command:
        * git clone `https://github.com/singlun/todo-capstone.git`. 
    2. After cloning, browse to the `client` folder. From the client folder,  you need to install the packages and dependencies for the frontend. Type in the following command in the client folder.
        * npm install
    3. After cloning, browse to the `k8s-restapi-todo` folder. From the folder,  you need to install the packages and dependencies for the backend. Type in the following command in the folder.
        * npm install        
    4. Build and Create the docker Images.
        * Browser to the folder `todo-deployment/docker`. Type the following command: 
        `docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yaml build --parallel`. This will build all the images for the Todo Project.
    5. Push all the images to the Docker Hub Repository. You need to have a Docker Hub account.
        * From the PowerShell Terminal. Type in `docker login`, you will be prompt in the username and password.
        * To push all the images to Docker Hub , type in `docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yaml push`.
    6. Run the project.
        * To run the Todo App. Type in `docker-compose up`.

## Installation-Todo-Kubernetes-Infrastructure 

   * From the Linux Machine :

        1. Export both your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in your terminal. If you quit your bash session you’ll have to do this again. Execute echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID to make sure you’ve done this correctly.

        2. Download Terraform and kubeone describe above.

        3. After download Kubeone. Unzip it.

        4. Browse to the folder `/examples/terraform/aws`.

        5. Copy the whole `aws` folder to the root directory.        

        6. Inside the `aws` folder, modify the variables.tf file. To make it simple, the only thing you need to modify is the `aws_region`. Please fill in the region of your AWS account.

        7. Then inside the `aws` folder. Type in the command `terraform init`.

        8. Then type in the command `terraform apply`. This will create the AWS infrasturctue according to the requirements that specify in the `variables.rf` file. This process will takes around 5 to 10 minutes.

        7. Then now comes to Deploy your K8s high up in the clouds. But before you need to do some preparation.

            * Please follow this link `https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent` to generate the public and private `ssh-key` and add it to the `ssh-agent`.

        8. Again inside the `aws` folder type in the command `kubeone config print > config.yaml`. This will generate a config file that will be used to deploy the k8s to the aws cloud. Open the file and modify the name to `todo-app-cluster`.

        9. Type in the command `kubeone install config.yaml -t .` to deploy the k8s to the AWS.

        10. After the install, there will be a `todo-app-kubeconfig` file generated.

        11. Backup the `todo-app-kubeconfig` file, and rename it to `config` and copy it to `$HOME/.kube`.


## Deploy-Todo-Kubernetes

   * From the Linux Machine :

        1. From the shell Terminal, type in the command:
            * git clone `https://github.com/singlun/todo-capstone.git`.   

        2. Browse to the folder `todo-deployment/k8s`. 

        3. Deploying Everything: 

            * By typing in the command `kubectl -f file-name apply`, `file-name` are the files in the k8s folder. 
                For instance : `kubectl -f frontend-deployment.yaml apply`.

    * Things need to remind `thanks to Dan B.`. 

        * Base64 credentials:

            - aws-secret.yaml
                * Find your credentials in ~/.aws/credentials.
                You need to save your key in base64 —> type in 'base64 credentials'  —> this output is what you save under “credentials” in your aws-secret.yaml file.
            - env-configmap.yaml
                * Make sure all these variables are correct. This is pretty self explanatory. You should know where to get these values if the are not   already saved in your bash profile.

        * CONSISTENCY IS KEY!!!

            If your reserve proxy is not running: Execute: kubectl logs ${your pod name here}

            To find your node value execute kubectl get nodes -o wide. Copy the NAME for all nodes that are MASTERS into the bash command above. This should fix your problem.

            If you have any “CrashLoopBackOff” Errors then you have a variable issue. Make sure your env-configmap.yaml has the proper values. If need be: Kubectl delete secret env-config update your env-configmap.yaml Kubectl apply -f env-configmap.yaml

        * Helpful commands:

            Kubectl describe pod/svc/rs/deployment ${name of pod/service/replicaset/deployment} Kubectl log ${name of pod/service/replicatset/deployemnt}

            Its helpful to look at the logs if something is wrong. It’ll show you the code output in your containers should you need to debug.
